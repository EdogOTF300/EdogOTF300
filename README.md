- 👋 Hi, I’m @EdogOTF300
- 👀 I’m interested in haskell an the crypto blockchain. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning computer programming (teaching myself)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate when I learn this language and can contribute. 
- 📫 You can contact me here ethanb1999@gmail.com but my programming skills are very low. I will update README.md when I fully understand how this stuff works.
